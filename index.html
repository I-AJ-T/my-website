            <h2 class="section_heading_text">How to play the game:</h2>
            <p>The <em>idle</em> portion of the game is <strong>stage</strong> based. Here players gain resources to level up their heroes to be able to fight the stage bosses. The higher a player goes in the stages, the harder the stages get!</p>
            <!--Add image of idle screen later-->
            <p class="list_heading">Here's a <strong>recommended</strong> way to play the game:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fight through the stages</li>
                <li>Level up heroes</li>
                <li>Fight the stage Boss</li>
                <li>Repeat</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you are <strong>unable</strong> to beat the boss let the game idle for a while so you can accumulate resources to level up your heroes to be strong enough to beat the boss. Then start repeating the listed process again.</p>

            <p>To gain more heroes you have to <strong>summon</strong> them. Heroes are summoned using either <strong>summoning tickets</strong> or <strong>gems</strong>. Summoned heroes come in different <strong>rarities</strong>! The higher the rarity the stronger the hero!</p>
            <!--Add image of hero summoning screen later-->
            <p class="list_heading">Hero rarities listed from <strong>strongest</strong> to <em>weakest</em>:</p>

            <!--Add image of rarities later-->
            <p>The heroes are split into collections that are part of a codex. In the codex, as hero collections are completed stat increases are gained. Stat increases gained from the codex are applied universally. This means that it is applied to a player's team as a whole regardless of what heroes are in the team.</p>

            <p>Yes, players can spend <em>real money</em> on the game in the shop to speed up their leveling process. <strong>However</strong>, the game is <strong>very generous</strong> in that if players are actively playing and participating in events, spending real money is not needed. The game gives out a lot of its in-game currencies as players progress through the game. <strong>JUST KEEP PLAYING!</strong></p>

            <p>The game also features <strong>pets</strong>. Pets are summoned and leveled up in a similar way to the heroes are. Additionally, pets have similar rarities except for <em>"High Lord"</em>. The main purpose of pets is to increase stats. The stat increases get better as the pet's level increases. Also, just like with the codex, the stat increases from pets are applied universally regardless of which pet is being used.</p>
