            <p>To gain more heroes you have to <strong>summon</strong> them. Heroes are summoned using either
                <strong>summoning tickets</strong> or <strong>gems</strong>. Summoned heroes come in different
                <strong>rarities</strong>! The higher the rarity the stronger the hero!

            <!--Add image of rarities later-->
            <p>The heroes are split into collections that are part of a codex. In the codex, as hero collections are
                completed stat increases are gained. Stat increases gained from the codex are applied universally. This
                means that it is applied to a player's team as a whole regardless of what heroes are in the team.</p>

            <p>Yes, players can spend <em>real money</em> on the game in the shop to speed up their leveling process.
                <strong>However</strong>, the game is <strong>very generous</strong> in that if players are actively
                playing and participating in events, spending real money is not needed. The game gives out a lot of its
                in-game currencies as players progress through the game. <strong>JUST KEEP PLAYING!</strong>

        <section> <!--This Section is about pets-->
            <h2 class="section_heading_text">About Pets:</h2>
            <p>The game also features <strong>pets</strong>. Pets are summoned and leveled up in a similar way to the
                heroes are. Additionally, pets have similar rarities except for <em>"High Lord"</em>. The main purpose
                of pets is to increase stats. The stat increases get better as the pet's level increases. Also, just
                like with the codex, the stat increases from pets are applied universally regardless of which pet is
                being used.</p>
